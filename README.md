# Reddit Persona Generator ðŸ§ 

A simple web app that builds detailed user personas based on a Reddit userâ€™s posts and comments. It scrapes Reddit data, then uses Google Gemini AI to analyze the content and generate insights about the userâ€™s personality, interests, motivations, and more. The results can be viewed in the app or downloaded as text and PDF files.

## Features
-> Scrapes up to 100 recent comments and 50 recent posts from any public Reddit user.   
-> Uses AI to generate a rich, narrative persona describing the userâ€™s traits and behavior.   
-> Outputs the persona in a clean, easy-to-read format.   
-> Allows downloading the persona as both a .txt and .pdf file.   
-> Responsive Streamlit web interface with a nice background and styled components.   

## How to Use

-> Enter the full Reddit profile URL (e.g., https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/).   
-> Click Generate Persona.  
-> Wait while the app scrapes Reddit and generates the persona using AI.   
-> View the generated persona directly in the app.   
-> Download the persona as a TXT or PDF file if needed.
